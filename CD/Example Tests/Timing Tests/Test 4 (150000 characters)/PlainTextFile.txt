As the name implies, a substitution operation involves replacing one thing with something else. In cryptography, it generally involves replacing one symbol (or group of symbols) with another symbol (or group of symbols). For example, in the Caesar Shift Cipher, each letter of the plaintext is replaced by the letter three places further down in the alphabet (wrapping back to the beginning if the end of the alphabet is reached). As the name implies, a substitution operation involves replacing one thing with something else. In cryptography, it generally involves replacing one symbol (or group of symbols) with another symbol (or group of symbols).

For example, in the Caesar Shift Cipher, each letter of the plaintext is replaced by the letter three places further down in the alphabet (wrapping back to the beginning if the end of the alphabet is reached). As the name implies, a substitution operation involves replacing one thing with something else. In cryptography, it generally involves replacing one symbol (or group of symbols) with another symbol (or group of symbols).

As the name implies, a substitution operation involves replacing one thing with something else. In cryptography, it generally involves replacing one symbol (or group of symbols) with another symbol (or group of symbols). For example, in the Caesar Shift Cipher, each letter of the plaintext is replaced by the letter three places further down in the alphabet (wrapping back to the beginning if the end of the alphabet is reached). As the name implies, a substitution operation involves replacing one thing with something else. In cryptography, it generally involves replacing one symbol (or group of symbols) with another symbol (or group of symbols). For example, in the Caesar Shift Cipher, each letter of the plaintext is replaced by the letter three places further down in the alphabet (wrapping back to the beginning if the end of the alphabet is reached). As the name implies, a substitution operation involves replacing one thing with something else.
